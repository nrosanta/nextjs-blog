## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

xUnit.net is a member of the xUnit family of testing frameworks, which includes JUnit and NUnit. It was created with a focus on simplicity, extensibility, and discoverability. xUnit.net works seamlessly with the .NET framework and supports multiple .NET languages, making it a valuable tool for developers working on .NET projects.

## Getting Started with xUnit.net<a name="getting-started"></a>

Getting started with xUnit.net involves a few essential steps to ensure you have everything set up for writing and running tests. This section will guide you through the process.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Visual Studio (Optional)**: While not mandatory, having Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code installed can make the development and testing process more convenient. xUnit.net integrates seamlessly with both IDEs.

2. **.NET SDK**: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from the official .NET website at [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### Creating a New xUnit.net Test Project

To get started with xUnit.net, you need to create a new test project where you will write your test classes and methods. Follow these steps to create a test project:

1. **Open your preferred development environment**: Whether you're using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other compatible IDE, open it to begin the setup.

2. **Create a new solution (optional)**: If you're building a new application, you can create a new solution to house both your main application project and the test project. This isn't mandatory, but it helps in organizing your code.

3. **Add a new project to the solution**:
   - In Visual Studio: Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer, select "Add," and then "New Project." Choose the appropriate project template for your application (e.g., Class Library, ASP.NET Core, etc.). Then, name the project and click "Create."
   - In Visual Studio Code or using the .NET CLI: Open the terminal and navigate to your desired directory. Run the following command to create a new project:
   
     ```bash
     dotnet new classlib -n YourProjectName
     ```

   Replace `YourProjectName` with the name of your project.

4. **Add xUnit.net to your project**:
   - In Visual Studio: Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, select "Manage NuGet Packages," search for "xunit" in the NuGet Package Manager, and install the `xunit` and `xunit.runner.visualstudio` packages.
   - In Visual Studio Code or using the .NET CLI: Open the terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to add xUnit.net:

     ```bash
     dotnet add package xunit
     ```

## Writing Your First xUnit.net Test<a name="writing-first-test"></a>

Now that you have your xUnit.net test project set up, you can start writing your first test. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Test Class**: Begin by defining a test class where you'll organize your tests. In xUnit.net, a test class is any class that contains test methods marked with attributes like `[Fact]` or `[Theory]`. Test classes can be in the same project as your application code or in separate test projects, following best practices for separation of concerns.

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class MathTests
{
    // Test methods go here
}
```

2. **Test Method**: Inside your test class, define one or more test methods. Each test method represents a specific aspect of your code that you want to verify. You mark these methods with `[Fact]` or `[Theory]` attributes, depending on whether the test is a simple fact or a data-driven theory.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void AddingTwoNumbers_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
{
    // Test logic goes here
}
```

3. **Test Logic**: Within each test method, you set up the necessary preconditions (Arrange), execute the code you want to test (Act), and then make assertions (Assert) about the expected outcome. It's important to keep these sections distinct to ensure the clarity of your tests.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void AddingTwoNumbers_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
{
    // Arrange
    int a = 3;
    int b = 5;

    // Act
    int result = MathHelper.Add(a, b);

    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(8, result);
}
```

In the example above, we're testing the `Add` method from a hypothetical `MathHelper` class. We've arranged the values of `a` and `b`, performed the addition, and then asserted that the result matches our expectation.

4. **Assertions**: xUnit.net provides various assertion methods to validate your test outcomes. In the example, we used `Assert.Equal(expected, actual)` to ensure that the `result` matches the expected sum.

5. **Running Tests**: After writing your tests, you need to execute them to check if your code behaves as expected. This is typically done using a test runner, which can be part of your integrated development environment (IDE) or a dedicated tool like the xUnit.net console runner (`dotnet test` for .NET Core/.NET 5+ projects).

```bash
dotnet test
```

The test runner will discover and execute your tests, providing feedback on whether they passed or failed.

6. **Test Output**: When a test fails, xUnit.net provides detailed output, helping you pinpoint the issue. This output includes information about the failing test, the expected vs. actual values, and the stack trace if an exception occurred.

Once you've successfully run your tests, you'll see the results and any output in your chosen test runner, and you can continue adding more tests to your project.


## xUnit.net Features<a name="features"></a>

xUnit.net offers several features that make it a powerful testing framework. Let's explore some of these features in more detail.

### Fact and Theory<a name="fact-theory"></a>

xUnit.net supports two types of tests: **Facts** and **Theories**. Facts are tests that always return the same result, while Theories allow you to parameterize your tests, enabling you to run the same test with multiple sets of data.

### Fact Tests

A **Fact** in xUnit.net represents a fundamental unit test. It is a test method marked with the `[Fact]` attribute, indicating that it should always produce the same result when run. Fact tests are typically used to verify specific behaviors of your code, where the expected outcome is consistent across all test runs.

Here's a recap of how a Fact test is structured:

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class MathTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void AddingTwoNumbers_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
    {
        // Test logic goes here
    }
}
```

In this example, we are testing the `AddingTwoNumbers_ShouldReturnCorrectSum` fact. This test method is expected to produce the same result each time it is executed because it does not depend on any external factors or input data. Fact tests are suitable for checking straightforward, deterministic scenarios in your code.

### Theory Tests

In contrast to Fact tests, **Theory** tests in xUnit.net are designed for data-driven testing. They allow you to run the same test method with different sets of input data, making it easy to validate your code's behavior across various conditions. You mark a test method as a Theory using the `[Theory]` attribute and supply data using `[InlineData]` or other attributes.

Here's an example of a Theory test:

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class MathTests
{
    [Theory]
    [InlineData(1, 2, 3)]   // Input: 1 and 2, Expected output: 3
    [InlineData(3, 4, 7)]   // Input: 3 and 4, Expected output: 7
    [InlineData(-2, 5, 3)]  // Input: -2 and 5, Expected output: 3
    public void AddingTwoNumbers_ShouldReturnCorrectSum(int a, int b, int expectedSum)
    {
        int result = MathHelper.Add(a, b);
        Assert.Equal(expectedSum, result);
    }
}
```

In this Theory test, the `AddingTwoNumbers_ShouldReturnCorrectSum` method is marked with the `[Theory]` attribute, and multiple sets of input data are provided using `[InlineData]`. The test method is executed once for each set of input data, and the provided data is used to validate the behavior of the code.

Theory tests are valuable when you want to test your code's behavior with a variety of input values or when you need to ensure that your code behaves correctly under different scenarios. They allow you to write a single test method that handles multiple test cases, making your test suite more efficient and maintainable.

In summary, Facts are suitable for simple, deterministic tests, while Theories are used for data-driven testing, enabling you to test your code with multiple sets of data, ensuring its robustness and correctness in various scenarios. Combining both Fact and Theory tests in your test suite provides a comprehensive approach to verifying the functionality of your code.

### Test Lifecycle<a name="test-lifecycle"></a>

xUnit.net manages the lifecycle of your test classes. It creates a new instance of the test class for each test method, ensuring that tests remain isolated and do not interfere with each other.

### Parallel Test Execution<a name="parallel-execution"></a>

xUnit.net can run tests in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core processors for faster test execution. This feature can significantly reduce the time it takes to run a suite of tests.

### Data Driven Testing<a name="data-driven-testing"></a>

You can use the `[ClassData]` or `[MemberData]` attributes to implement data-driven testing, making it easy to test your code with multiple sets of data.

### Custom Test Attributes<a name="custom-attributes"></a>

xUnit.net allows you to create custom test attributes, enabling you to define your own test conventions and behaviors.

### Exception Testing<a name="exception-testing"></a>

You can use the `[InlineData]` attribute in conjunction with the `[Theory]` attribute to write tests that validate exceptions are thrown under specific conditions.

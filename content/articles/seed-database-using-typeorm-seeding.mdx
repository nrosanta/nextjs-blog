Seeding your database is an essential step in the application development process. It not only facilitates prototyping but also streamlines the transition to a production environment. Whether you're in the early stages of ideation or have a fully-fledged application, database seeding can be a game-changer. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to seed your database using TypeORM and TypeORM Seeding, focusing on creating random data and establishing relationships.

## Setting Up the Project

First, let's set up your project. In the root directory of your project (where your `package.json` is located), install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install typeorm-seeding faker --save
npm install @types/faker --save-dev
```

## Understanding Factories

Before we dive into seeding, let's understand the concept of factories. Factories are essential for generating data to populate your application. For each entity in your application, you define a factory. Each factory is responsible for generating data corresponding to the properties of the entity.

For instance, if you have the following entities:

```typescript
// @/src/db/entities/user.ts
import {
  Entity,
  PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
  Column,
  OneToMany,
  BaseEntity,
} from "typeorm";
import { Post } from "./post";

@Entity()
export class User extends BaseEntity {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id!: number;

  @Column()
  name!: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.user)
  posts?: Post[];
}

// @/src/db/entities/post.ts
import {
  Entity,
  PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
  Column,
  ManyToOne,
  BaseEntity,
} from "typeorm";
import { User } from "./user";

@Entity()
export class Post extends BaseEntity {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id!: number;

  @Column()
  title!: string;

  @Column()
  description!: string;

  @Column({ type: "boolean", default: false })
  isPublished!: boolean;

  @ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts)
  user!: User;
}
```

For the `User` entity, you might define a factory like this:

```typescript
// @/src/db/seeding/factories/user.factory.ts
import * as Faker from "faker";
import { define } from "typeorm-seeding";
import { User } from "../../entities";

define(User, (faker: typeof Faker) => {
  const user = new User();
  const firstName = faker.name.firstName();
  const lastName = faker.name.lastName();
  user.name = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
  return user;
});
```

And for the `Post` entity:

```typescript
// @/src/db/seeding/factories/post.factory.ts
import * as Faker from "faker";
import { define } from "typeorm-seeding";
import { Post } from "../../entities";

define(Post, (faker: typeof Faker) => {
  const post = new Post();
  post.title = faker.lorem.words(8);
  post.description = faker.lorem.paragraph(6);
  post.isPublished = faker.random.boolean();
  return post;
});
```

With these factories defined, you can generate random data for your entities.

## Creating a Seeder

Now, let's create a seeder, which is responsible for executing the database seeding. The seeder class name should match the name of the seed class (not the filename). Here's a basic structure for a seeder:

```typescript
// @/src/db/seeding/seeds/initialSeed.ts
import { Factory, Seeder } from "typeorm-seeding";
import { Connection } from "typeorm";

export default class InitialDatabaseSeed implements Seeder {
  public async run(factory: Factory, connection: Connection): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Import the entities you want to seed, like so:

```typescript
import { Factory, Seeder } from "typeorm-seeding";
import { Connection } from "typeorm";
import { User, Post } from "../../entities";

export default class InitialDatabaseSeed implements Seeder {
  public async run(factory: Factory, connection: Connection): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Seeding the Database

Now, let's seed the database. First, create users and specify how many you want to insert:

```typescript
const users = await factory(User)().createMany(15);
```

Next, generate articles. This time, we'll also associate each article with a random user:

```typescript
await factory(Post)()
  .map(async (post) => {
    post.user = users[Math.floor(Math.random() * users.length)];
    return post;
  })
  .createMany(100);
```

## Configuring TypeORM

To ensure TypeORM knows where to find your factories and seeders, update your `ormconfig.ts` file:

```javascript
// @/ormconfig.ts
import { User, Post } from "./src/db/entities";

export default {
  name: "default",
  type: "sqlite",
  database: "src/db/dev.db",
  entities: [User, Post],
  synchronize: true,
  logging: false,
  seeds: ["src/db/seeding/seeds/**/*{.ts,.js}"],
  factories: ["src/db/seeding/factories/**/*{.ts,.js}"],
};
```

## Seeding Your Database

Finally, add a script to your `package.json` to run the seeding process:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:seed": "ts-node ./node_modules/typeorm-seeding/dist/cli.js seed"
  }
}
```

Make sure your API is running, and execute the following command to seed your database:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

And that's it! Your database is now populated with random data. This is a powerful way to test your application and ensure it's ready for production. Happy coding!

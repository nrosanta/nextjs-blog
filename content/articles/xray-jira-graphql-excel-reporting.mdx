In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of extracting test execution data from Xray Cloud using the GraphQL API and writing the data to an Excel file. We will use Python and the following libraries:

- `gql` for making GraphQL queries.
- `openpyxl` for working with Excel files.
- `requests` for making HTTP requests.

The tutorial will be structured as follows:

1. Prerequisites
2. Set Up Authentication
3. Define GraphQL Query
4. Extract Test Execution Data
5. Write Data to Excel
6. Full Python Script
7. Conclusion

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python installed on your system.
- Necessary Python libraries installed (`gql`, `openpyxl`, and `requests`).
- Access to Xray Cloud with a client ID and client secret.
- An Excel file where you want to store the extracted data.

## Set Up Authentication

In order to access the Xray Cloud GraphQL API, you need to obtain an access token using your client ID and client secret. The `get_token` function in the provided code can be used to do this. Replace the `client_id` and `client_secret` with your own values.

```python
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
token_endpoint = 'https://xray.cloud.getxray.app/api/v1/authenticate'

access_token = get_token(client_id, client_secret, token_endpoint)
```

## Define GraphQL Query

The GraphQL query in the code retrieves test execution data from Xray Cloud. You can modify the query to suit your specific needs. The `gql` library allows you to create complex queries easily.

```python
graphql_query = gql("""
query($limit: Int!, $start: Int!, $jql: String!)
{
    getTestExecutions(jql: $jql, limit: 1) {
        total
        start
        results {
        issueId
        jira(fields: ["key", "summary"])
        projectId
        testRuns(limit: $limit, start: $start) {
            total
            start
            results {
            status {
                name
            }
            test {
              jira(fields:["key", "summary", "assignee"])
            }
            }
        }
        }
    }
}
""")
```

## Extract Test Execution Data

The `get_xray_data` function is responsible for making GraphQL requests to Xray Cloud, paginating through the results, and returning the data as a list of test executions.

```python
data = get_xray_data(jql_query_API, access_token)
```

## Write Data to Excel

The `write_to_excel` function is used to write the extracted test execution data to an Excel file. The function takes the worksheet and data as arguments and clears any existing data before writing the new data.

```python
file_path = "path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx"
worksheet_name = 'Sheet1'

wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename=file_path)
ws = wb[worksheet_name]

if data:
    write_to_excel(ws, data)
    wb.save(filename=file_path)
```

## Full Python Script

Here's the full Python script that combines all the steps above:

```python
from gql import Client, gql
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport
import openpyxl
import requests

# Set up your authentication
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
token_endpoint = 'https://xray.cloud.getxray.app/api/v1/authenticate'
access_token = get_token(client_id, client_secret, token_endpoint)

# Define your GraphQL query
graphql_query = gql("""
query($limit: Int!, $start: Int!, $jql: String!)
{
    getTestExecutions(jql: $jql, limit: 1) {
        total
        start
        results {
        issueId
        jira(fields: ["key", "summary"])
        projectId
        testRuns(limit: $limit, start: $start) {
            total
            start
            results {
            status {
                name
            }
            test {
              jira(fields:["key", "summary", "assignee"])
            }
            }
        }
        }
    }
}
""")

# Get API Execution Data
worksheet_name = 'API_Execution_Raw'
jql_query_API = "project=VIVAQE and summary ~ 'API Automation'"
data = get_xray_data(jql_query_API, access_token)
file_path = "path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx"
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename=file_path)
ws = wb[worksheet_name]

if data:
    write_to_excel(ws, data)
    wb.save(filename=file_path)
    print(f'Test Execution: {executionKey} - {executionSummary}')
    print(f'Total tests found: {len(data)}')

# Get UI Execution Data (you can repeat this section for different data)
worksheet_name = 'UI_Execution_Raw'
jql_query_UI = "project=VIVAQE and summary ~ 'UI Automation'"
data = get_xray_data(jql_query_UI, access_token)
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename=file_path)
ws = wb[worksheet_name]

if data:
    write_to_excel(ws, data)
    wb.save(filename=file_path)
    print(f'Test Execution: {executionKey} - {executionSummary}')
    print(f'Total tests found: {len(data)}')

# Get UAT Execution Data (you can repeat this section for different data)
worksheet_name = 'UAT_Execution_Raw'
jql_query_UAT = "project=VIVAQE and key=VIVAQE-873"
data = get_xray_data(jql_query_UAT, access_token)
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename=file_path)
ws = wb[worksheet_name]

if data:
    write_to_excel(ws, data)
    wb.save(filename=file_path)
    print(f'Test Execution: {executionKey} - {executionSummary}')
    print(f'Total tests found: {len(data)}')
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to extract test execution data from Xray Cloud using Python and GraphQL and write it to an Excel file. You can adapt the code to retrieve different sets of data and customize the Excel file to meet your reporting needs.

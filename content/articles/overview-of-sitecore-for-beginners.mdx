1. In the Sitecore content tree, navigate to the location where you want to add the new content.

2. Right-click on the desired location and select "Insert" to create a new item.

3. Choose the template that best matches your content type (e.g., a "Standard Page" template for a basic web page).

4. Fill in the content fields, add images or other media, and save your changes.

### 4.3 Editing Content <a name="editing-content"></a>

Editing content in Sitecore is straightforward. When you open a content item, you can make changes directly in the content editor. Sitecore provides a WYSIWYG editor, which allows you to format text, insert images, and manage links. Additionally, Sitecore offers version control, so you can keep track of changes and restore previous versions if needed.

## 5. Sitecore Development <a name="sitecore-development"></a>
### 5.1 Programming Languages <a name="programming-languages"></a>

Sitecore primarily uses C# for server-side development and JavaScript for client-side development. Here's a brief overview:

- **Server-Side (C#)**: Sitecore is built on the .NET framework and uses C# for server-side development. Developers use C# to create custom components, templates, and business logic within the Sitecore CMS.

- **Client-Side (JavaScript)**: JavaScript is frequently used for client-side development in Sitecore. It's essential for creating interactive user interfaces, enhancing the user experience, and integrating with external services. Common JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery, are often utilized to add interactivity to Sitecore-powered web pages.

</div>


**Example**: Imagine an inventory management system for a used car dealership powered by Sitecore. In this scenario, JavaScript plays a vital role in creating a user-friendly interface for managing the dealership's inventory and providing valuable information to potential car buyers.

1. **Front-End Frameworks**: The system utilizes a JavaScript front-end framework to build an intuitive and responsive user interface. It allows dealership staff to easily add, edit, and categorize car listings, as well as enabling customers to browse the available cars efficiently.

2. **Custom Components**: JavaScript is employed to create custom components for car listings. Each listing includes details such as the car's make, model, year, price, and features. Users can view high-resolution images and even take virtual tours of the cars using interactive image carousels.

3. **API Integration**: The system uses JavaScript to integrate with external APIs for real-time data. For example, it connects to vehicle history report services to provide buyers with comprehensive information about a car's past, including accident history, ownership, and maintenance records.

4. **Personalization and Tracking**: JavaScript enables personalization features, allowing the system to recommend cars to potential buyers based on their preferences and previous interactions with the site. It tracks user interactions, such as the cars they've viewed or added to their favorites, to offer tailored recommendations.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Client-side performance is critical for a fast and engaging user experience. JavaScript is used to optimize the loading of car listings and images, ensuring that the website loads quickly and efficiently. Lazy loading is implemented to load additional images as users scroll through the listings.

This inventory management system streamlines the process of adding new cars to the dealership's inventory, managing existing listings, and providing a seamless browsing experience for car buyers. It leverages JavaScript to create an engaging and user-friendly interface, making it easier for customers to find their ideal used cars.

This guide provides an overview of accessibility testing, focusing on WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) compliance, automated testing using the Axe-Core library, and severity levels of issues identified during testing.

## 1. WCAG Levels <a name="wcag-levels"></a>

WCAG divides accessibility guidelines into three levels of conformance:

- **WCAG Level A:** The minimum level of conformance.
- **WCAG Level AA:** The target conformance level, often required by legal standards like ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act).
- **WCAG Level AAA:** The highest level of conformance, meeting all three levels' success criteria.

Compliance with Level AA implies compliance with Level A.

## 2. WCAG 2.0 Level A & AA Rules <a name="wcag-rules"></a>

For a comprehensive list of WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA rules, refer to [this resource](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md#wcag-20-level-a--aa-rules).

## 3. Test Scope <a name="test-scope"></a>

Your testing scope should align with WCAG Level AA compliance. According to WCAG, adherence to the following four main principles is crucial:

- **Operable:** Ensure users can navigate your website using a keyboard in addition to a mouse.
- **Perceivable:** Make information and content accessible through audio descriptions, transcriptions, and closed captions.
- **Robust:** Your site should be compatible with screen readers and adaptable to users' changing needs.
- **Understandable:** Ensure text is readable, expands abbreviations, and uses formats that don't require advanced reading abilities.

## 4. Out of Scope <a name="out-of-scope"></a>

Accessibility testing should not include testing with assistive technologies that real users use. For a more comprehensive understanding of users with disabilities, refer to [WebAIM's survey results](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey7/).

## 5. Automated Test <a name="automated-test"></a>

Automated accessibility testing is crucial for maintaining compliance. In the case of MAP, it will be automated using the Axe-Core library within the End-to-End (E2E) automation framework using Playwright. Configure Axe-Core to ensure MAP complies with WCAG AA rules for ADA compliance. Refer to [Axe-Core on GitHub](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) for detailed information.

## 6. Axe-Core Report Severity Levels <a name="severity-levels"></a>

During automated testing with Axe-Core, issues are categorized into four severity levels:

- **Minor:** Considered nuisances or annoyances. Fix promptly if it takes minimal effort; otherwise, prioritize appropriately.
- **Moderate:** Result in some barriers but don't prevent access to fundamental features. Prioritize in the release if no higher-priority issues exist.
- **Serious:** Result in significant barriers and frustration for people with disabilities. Remediation should be a priority.
- **Critical:** Block content for people with disabilities, putting your organization at risk. Prioritize immediate remediation.

## 7. Useful Links <a name="useful-links"></a>

For further resources on accessibility testing and Axe-Core:

- [Axe-Core on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core)
- [Axe-Playwright on GitHub](https://github.com/abhinaba-ghosh/axe-playwright)
- [Deque's Axe-Core Documentation](https://www.deque.com/axe/core-documentation/api-documentation/)

## 8. Axe-Core Supported Browsers <a name="supported-browsers"></a>

Axe-Core, used for automated accessibility testing, supports the following browsers:

- Microsoft Edge v40 and above
- Google Chrome v42 and above
- Mozilla Firefox v38 and above
- Apple Safari v7 and above

Ensuring accessibility in your digital content is essential to make it inclusive and ADA-compliant. By following these guidelines and leveraging Axe-Core for automated testing, you can proactively address accessibility issues and provide a more accessible online experience for all users.


## 9. Automated Accessibility Testing with Axe-Playwright <a name="example"></a>

In this example, we will demonstrate how to perform automated accessibility testing using Axe-Playwright within the Playwright framework on the Wikipedia website. We will use TypeScript for scripting this test.

```typescript
import { Page, BrowserContext, devices } from 'playwright';
import { setupPlaywright } from 'axe-playwright';

// Define the URL of the Wikipedia website you want to test.
const wikipediaURL = 'https://en.wikipedia.org';

// Define the Playwright device to emulate a desktop view.
const device = devices['Desktop 1920x1080'];

(async () => {
  // Launch a browser instance and create a browser context with the Playwright device configuration.
  const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch();
  const context: BrowserContext = await browser.newContext({
    ...device,
  });

  // Create a new page within the context and navigate to the Wikipedia website.
  const page: Page = await context.newPage();
  await page.goto(wikipediaURL);

  // Inject Axe-Core into the page for accessibility testing.
  const { configureAxe, toHaveNoViolations } = setupPlaywright();
  await configureAxe(page);

  // Run an accessibility scan on the page and check for violations.
  await page.evaluate(() => axe.run());
  const results = await page.waitForFunction(toHaveNoViolations, { timeout: 5000 });

  // Output the accessibility results to the console.
  console.log('Accessibility test results:', results);

  // Close the browser instance.
  await browser.close();
})();
```

It launches a browser, navigates to the Wikipedia site, injects Axe-Core for accessibility testing, scans the page, and checks for violations. The results are then logged to the console. Ensure you have Playwright and Axe-Playwright installed in your project to run this code.
